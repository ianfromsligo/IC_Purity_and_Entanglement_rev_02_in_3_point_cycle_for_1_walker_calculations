### Experiment 001 W=1,k=3,N=8 PD,P,S
## One walker, 3 point circle, calculating probability distribution, purity and entropy
# Description
This file contains the latex for the calculations of 8 steps for the walker.  The probability distribution, purity and entanglement entropy are calculated.
A python program experimentally produces the same results.
